This update adds a new subpage for "Related Work", intended to provide additional source material and accessible via the navbar (or [this link](/COMIDDS/content/related_work)).
Contents are divided into "Publications" and "Collections", where the former is any academic work that at least partially covers the topic of available IDS datasets.
Entries of this category, which are usually surveys, consist of the following:
- Publication title
- Citation
- Short description of the publication
- List of referenced datasets
- List of referenced collections

Referenced datasets link to their respective entries on this webpage, if available.
Those that are not (which are quite a few) will be looked at and possibly be added to COMIDDS in the future.

The latter category, "Collections", simply features dataset collections not backed by a scientific publication.
These are maintained by individuals or organizations, and cover different types of datasets, ranging from "only pcaps" to "anything cybersecurity-related".
Entries consist of:
- Collection name
- Link
- Date of last update, i.e., the last time a new entry was added
- Short description of the focus of this collection

There is of course a significant overlap between the different publications/collections, for example, almost every survey references the age-old [KDD Cup 1999 dataset](/COMIDDS/content/datasets/kdd_cup_1999).
The diversity of collections might nevertheless prove useful, as each resource provides a slightly different viewpoint upon the topic of IDS datasets.
