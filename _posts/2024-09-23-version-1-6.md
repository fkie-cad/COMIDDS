TL;DR:
- Added tool for automatically checking link health (both internal and external)
- Updated dozens of outdated links
- Two new datasets: I-Sec-IDS, ISCX Botnet 2014

Given the natural decay of URLs - niceties like DOI links aside - we thought it useful to have some way of easily checking the current status of everything we are linking to here in this project.
A script doing exactly that can now be found in `tools/check_url_health.py` (verifies external, absolute/relative internal links and anchors).
While the process of actually updating these links is still a manual one, this at least alerts us of the issue.
Admittedly, we were surprised by the relatively large number of links (~30) that have already fallen prey to said decay;
they have been updated where possible.

New dataset entries:
- [I-Sec-IDS](/COMIDDS/content/datasets/i_sec_ids)
- [ISCX Botnet 2014](/COMIDDS/content/datasets/iscx_botnet_2014)

As we've nearly covered all major datasets, new additions will slow down to an expected cadence of every 1-2 months.
However, external contributions and pull requests remain highly encouraged!
