TL;DR:
- Renamed repository (and all associated references) to "COMIDDS" to facilitate publication and increase recognition value
- Add "Times Recently Cited" as a new field to every entry, with information being automatically updated via the Semantic Scholar API
  - This information can also be found in the generated CSV file
- Three new datasets: OD-IDS2022, SR-BH 2020, AWID
- Various small changes and fixes to the underlying structure of the website (no content changes)

With this update, the entire project has been rebranded to "COMIDDS" - a **com**prehensive, continuous, and collaborative **i**ntrusion **d**etection **d**atasets **s**urvey.
As the old name (Intrusion Detection Datasets) was hardly unique and already used by other works, this facilitates publication while providing more recognition value.

Aside from this, the major new feature of v1.5.0 is the inclusion of "citation counts".
The [table of all datasets](/COMIDDS/content/all_datasets) now includes a new column informing about the total number of times a given dataset (or rather its underlying paper) has been cited *in the last five years*.
This information is obtained by leveraging the [Semantic Scholar API](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api) and updated automatically whenever the website is re-deployed (which happens every couple of weeks).
Of course, this information can only be supplied if the dataset in question is backed by a publication - if that's not the case, the field is simply left empty.

New dataset entries:
- [OD-IDS2022](/COMIDDS/content/datasets/od_ids2022)
- [SR-BH 2020](/COMIDDS/content/datasets/sr_bh_2020)
- [AWID](/COMIDDS/content/datasets/awid)
