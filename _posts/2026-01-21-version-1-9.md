TL;DR:
- Two new datasets, DEDALE and CasinoLimit
- A couple of dead links updated

[StealthCup](https://github.com/ait-cs-IaaS/StealthCup2025), a dataset quite similar to CasinoLimit, was also planned as part of this release, but will be moved to the next one as the logs themselves are yet to be made available.
In general, new versions of COMIDDS in the future will usually be prompted by the release of promising new datasets, as there is little point in adding dozens of niche datasets that mostly more than a decade old and of little interest to the community.
Researchers remain encouraged to submit entries for their own datasets.

New dataset entries:

- [CasinoLimit](/COMIDDS/content/datasets/casinolimit)
