TL;DR:
- Two new datasets
- Added new related work
- A couple of dead links updated
- Improved link health checker

The changes in this version are quite similar to the previous v1.7, and chances are that future updates will not deviate too much from this pattern (unless perhaps COMIDDS receives a sudden influx of community contributions).
Most of the dead links that were found in v1.7 have been restored, with the exception of some older UNB datasets which are and will most likely continue to be unavailable.
The URL health checker has received some minor improvements regarding the verification of DOI links.

New dataset entries:
