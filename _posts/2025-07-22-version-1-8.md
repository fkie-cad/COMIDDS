TL;DR:
- Two new datasets
- A couple of dead links updated
- Improved link health checker

This is the exact same TL;DR as for the previous v1.7, and chances are that future updates will not deviate too much from this (unless perhaps COMIDDS receives a sudden influx of community contributions).
Most of the dead links that were found in v1.7 have been restored, with the exception of some older UNB datasets which are and will most likely continue to be unavailable.
The URL health checker has received some minor improvements regarding the verification of DOI links.
