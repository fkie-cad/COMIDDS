TL;DR:
- Two new datasets
- A couple of dead links updated
- Improved link health checker

With nearly all major datasets now having been added to COMIDDS, the task of adding more of them has comfortably settled in the "Someday" category of my to-do list.
Still, it can't remain there forever, lest the promised update frequency of "months" turns into "years".
While at it, I also slightly improved the link health checker to now use a "proper" header (instead of the generic one used by Python's requests) to lessen the likelihood of getting undesired server responses.
The Kyoto Honeypot dataset as well as the LID-DS dataset are currently experiencing issues / cannot be accessed, but at the time of creating this update, the issue has not been resolved.
