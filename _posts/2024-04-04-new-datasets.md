This update adds a couple of new dataset entries, changes some existing ones, and adds information on how to cite this website.

New dataset entries:
- [CIC DoS](/intrusion-detection-datasets/content/datasets/cic_dos)
- [CIC-DDoS2019](/intrusion-detection-datasets/content/datasets/cic_ddos)
- [gureKDDCup](/intrusion-detection-datasets/content/datasets/gure_kddcup)
- [User-Computer Associations in Time](/intrusion-detection-datasets/content/datasets/user_computer_associations)

Changes to existing entries:
- Modified all datasets which are derived from the [DARPA'98 dataset](/intrusion-detection-datasets/content/datasets/darpa98) to refer to it instead of containing the same copy/pasted description
- Updated download source for [NSL-KDD](/intrusion-detection-datasets/content/datasets/nsl_kdd_dataset) as the old link was deprecated

Other changes:
- Added info on how this website can be cited in [About](/intrusion-detection-datasets/content/about)
- Updated links in [Related Work](/intrusion-detection-datasets/content/related_work) to point to new entries
- Minor changes to the repositories README
