# Overview
This repository hosts the website for [Intrusion Detection Datasets](https://fkie-cad.github.io/intrusion-detection-datasets/), a collection of datasets suitable for the analysis, evaluation and development of intrusion detection methods.
The scope of this collection can generally be described as "log datasets that enable generation of IDS alerts";
the main goal is to provide a comprehensive and detailed list of available datasets, aiding researchers in finding and selecting suitable data to work with.
Each dataset has a separate entry, listing key features and describing the underlying scenario, activity, etc.
