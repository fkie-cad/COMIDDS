# COMIDDS

A Comprehensive, Continuous, and Collaborative Survey of Intrusion Detection Datasets.

**The content  of this repository is intended to be viewed through its [github.io site](https://fkie-cad.github.io/COMIDDS/)!**

## Content and Goals

This repository contains the website for *COMIDDS*, an overview of datasets for research in intrusion detection.
Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and detailed list of relevant datasets along with descriptions and links, aiding researchers in finding and selecting suitable data to work with.
Beyond the [table of all datasets](https://fkie-cad.github.io/COMIDDS/content/all_datasets/), each dataset has a separate page, listing key features and describing the underlying environment, activity, contained data, etc.

We mainly focus on datasets suited for developing and evaluating methods for intrusion detection in enterprise networks, i.e., common office environments involving applications such as browsing, emailing, or text processing as well as services such as web, email, or database servers.
We intentionally omit datasets from very different environments such as industrial control systems or Internet exchange points.
