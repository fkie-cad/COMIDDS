# THIS SPECIFIC WORKFLOW FILE IS INTENDED TO TEST CHANGES TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE WEBSITE!

# Since changes made to GitHub Actions only take effect when they are present in main, I've decided to include this
# additional workflow to facilitate testing new processes without breaking our ability to deploy the prior version of
# our website using the original workflow.

# Keep in mind that, in order to deploy the website from another branch, you MUST first modify the environment:
# Settings --> Environments --> click on github-pages --> Add new rule for your branch

# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages
name: Experimental deployment

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  # Uncomment this if we want to redeploy after any change has occurred on main (not that sensible imo)
#  push:
#    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
