### Legend

¹ "Times Recently Cited" counts any time the underlying publication of a given dataset has been referenced by other publications **in the last five years**.
This data is sourced from the  [Semantic Scholar API](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api).
Some datasets are not backed by a publication and thus do not show a number here.

² Labeling:
- 🟩: Direct; provides explicit labels on at least a portion of the contained data
- 🟨: Indirect; provides some form of ground truth that allows for manual or automatic labeling (e.g., periods of attack)
- 🟥: No labels; does not provide any form of explicit labels or information that would allow for their creation
