Hi, and thank you for considering to contribute!
As there are a lot of IDS-adjacent datasets out there, any help in documenting them on a sufficient level of detail is more than welcome.
Alternatively, although I tried to be as thorough as possible during my own research (while spending a reasonable amount of time per dataset), it is of course likely that I have missed some information, or made slight mistakes.
Any help in this regard, as in improving existing entries, is also much appreciated.

You can contribute in one of two ways:

- Open a [new issue](https://github.com/Maspital/Intrusion-Detection-Datasets/issues/new/choose) in our repository, describing your suggestions for improvement.
- Fork this repository, implement your suggested changes, and then open a pull request.

If you want to contribute a new dataset entry, please use this [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maspital/Intrusion-Detection-Datasets/main/docs/new_entry_template.md) from the documentation.
A new entry should consist of said template filled out and named appropriately, placed in `/content/datasets/`.
Additionally, a new row should be added to the list of all datasets in `/content/all_datasets.md`, adding information to each cell as needed.

On every page you will also find an "Edit Page" button at the bottom leading you to GitHub, where you will be prompted to fork this repository - saving you a few clicks when you want to edit an existing entry.
While contributions should generally be aimed towards datasets, suggestions regarding the underlying structure (like the website itself) are of course also welcome.
