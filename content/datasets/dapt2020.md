### Overview

The Dataset for Advanced Persistent Threats (DAPT) was created with the goal of providing a cybersecurity dataset
representative of an enterprise being the victim of an APT campaign.
The authors define such a campaign as a chain of attacks that covers certain categories - in this case Reconnaissance,
Foothold Establishment, Lateral Movement, and Data Exfiltration.
"Cover Up" is later mentioned as a fifth category, but declared out of scope for this work.

### Environment

The environment is simulated leveraging four distinct machines (as VMs):

- Private VM, hosting services like Samba, WordPress, FTP or MySQL
- Public VM, hosting (vulnerable) services like DVWA, BadStore and Metasploitable
- Gateway Router VM, connecting to the outside, entry point for the attacker
- Log Server, hosting an ELK cluster for log collection and management

Private and public VM as well as the log server belong to the internal network, with access to the outside provided by
the gateway router.

### Activity

This setup ran for a duration of five days, with the first one containing only benign activities, and each of the
remaining four days consisting of both benign and malicious activities.
Benign behavior does not seem to be simulated, but rather performed by students: "normal users (students with basic
knowledge of website maintenance and access), used shopping interface to check out items, browse different options,
create posts on the website, add comments on particular items, etc.".

### Contained Data

Logs are collected centrally by the log server, and include the following sources:

- pcaps
- Logs of system events (syslog)
- MySQL access logs
- Auditd host IDS logs
- Apache Access Logs
- Authentication Logs
- Logs from services (WordPress, docker, samba, ftp)
- DNS logs

Pcaps are not provided as-is, but in the form of network flows using CICFlowMeter, and are grouped per day - an
explanation for these features used is available on the linked GitLab homepage.
The remaining logs are sadly not sorted in an obvious manner - additionally, while the network flows are dated from
15/07 to 19/07 (the mentioned 5 days of simulation), a substantial number of logs are dated well outside this range,
which is not mentioned or explained by the authors.
Labels are only available for network flows, consisting of "activity" (the specific attack) and "stage" (the current APT
stage) associated with that flow.
