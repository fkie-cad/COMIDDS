### Environment
A description of the environment the dataset originated from, including networks, operating systems, running services, etc.

### Activity
What kind of activity, benign and malicious, was performed during the period of data collection.

### Data Examples
Snippet from the dataset, ideally one for each data type.
Note that multi-word annotations (like `json lines`) will not render properly on GitHub Pages.
Wrapping these snippets with `raw`/`endraw` is not strictly required, but prevents Liquid from parsing anything it shouldn't.
