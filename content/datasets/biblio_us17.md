### Papers
- [Biblio-US17: A labeled real URL dataset for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems development (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3655693.3661319)

### Links

### Data Examples
Snippet from the dataset, ideally one for each data type.
Note that multi-word annotations (like `json lines`) will not render properly on GitHub Pages.
Wrapping these snippets with `raw`/`endraw` is not strictly required, but prevents Liquid from parsing anything it shouldn't.
