### Overview
DEDALE (Dataset for Evaluating Detection of APT among Logs and Events) is a network and host intrusion detection dataset generated using the RESCOUSSE testbed.
The dataset spans 28 days and contains a fully-fledged APT campaign, preceded and followed by several days of only benign behavior.
The authors try to improve upon existing similar works (specifically referencing [SOCBED](https://github.com/fkie-cad/socbed)) by increasing both size and complexity of the virtualized network, running the attack campaign over several days as well as offering more sophisticated user emulation.

### Environment
The environment consists of a multi-zone corporate network architecture with 55 virtual machines distributed across four network zones, connected via three routers:
- External (attacker and external clients)
- DMZ (web servers, VPN server)
- Internal Servers (domain controller with SMB shares, internal server)
- Internal Clients (30 Windows company workstations)

The system runs various services including web servers, email (SMTP), SSH, SMB file sharing, VPN, DNS, and different office applications.
A visual representation of the entire structure can be found on their [homepage](https://dedale.inria.fr/rescousse.html).

### Activity
Benign activity is generated by AURA (Automated UseR Activity), a custom tool created by the same authors that simulates corporate user behavior across different user profiles like developer or manager.
Activities include email communication with attachments, web browsing to various sites, file operations (creation, modification, copying), SSH commands, printing, and VPN connections.
Scheduled timelines for these benign activities are provided separately.

The APT attack scenario runs over 8 days beginning in week 3, consisting of:
- Initial Access via spear phishing email with malicious macro attachment
- Execution of PowerShell script downloading HTTPS meterpreter reverse shell
- Persistence through registry key modifications
- C2 using custom Python malware with daily beaconing
- Discovery of domain credentials
- Lateral Movement to domain administrator machine via PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-1675)
- Collection of domain credentials and sensitive files from internal server
- Exfiltration to C2 server

An illustration of the attack campaign can be found [here](https://dedale.inria.fr/attack_scenario.html).

### Contained Data
Network data is captured at four distinct monitoring points, each available as weekly PCAP archives:
- ``green_internal``
- ``orange_servers``
- ``orange_dmz``
- ``router1`` with three interfaces (router1_green, router1_orange, router1_red).

Suricata alerts are included, but not explicitly labeled, although the authors mention that only 2 out of 130,430 Suricata alerts are true positive (related to a malicious flow).
Network flows, generated from the PCAPs above, are labeled with one of three classes, additionally providing the associated MITRE ATT&CK tactic and technique numbers if relevant:
- 0 (benign)
- 1 (attack)
- 2 (attack-related but not inherently malicious)

System logs are collected via Winlogbeat, Syslog and Auditbeat, organized by day.
Packetbeat logs are also listed as part of the system logs, although they are based on network traffic - possibly because the authors wanted to group all Elastic Beats together, because they considered any host-based collection as "system" data, or due to a simple oversight.
System logs related to the attack scenario are provided in separate files containing only logs related to malicious activity;
these are a subset of the unlabeled logs and grouped into two classes:
- Class 1: logs clearly linked to a malicious action
- Class 2: logs that are consequences or dependent on how the attack step works

Only logs from Winlogbeat (`system_labels/clients_1_and_2/`) and Auditbeat (`system_labels/internal_server/`) are labeled in this way, there appear to be no labels for Syslog entries.
The technical process of both host and network labeling is documented [here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/mlanvin/dedale_labeling).
