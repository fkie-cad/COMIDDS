### Overview
The University of Brescia (UNIBS) dataset was created to showcase the capabilities of the "GT" tool, 

### Environment
A description of the environment the dataset originated from, including networks, operating systems, running services, etc.

### Activity
What kind of activity, benign and malicious, was performed during the period of data collection.

### Contained Data
What kind of data was collected and how it is present in the dataset, including any processing and labeling.

### Papers
- [GT: picking up the truth from the ground for internet traffic (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1145/1629607.1629610)

### Links

### Data Examples
Snippet from the dataset, ideally one for each data type.
Note that multi-word annotations (like `json lines`) will not render properly on GitHub Pages.
Wrapping these snippets with `raw`/`endraw` is not strictly required, but prevents Liquid from parsing anything it shouldn't.
